To test your output:
====================
1- Please make sure you put the output of the test cases in a txt file with the same format as the given output files (Output1.txt & Output2.txt) as the following:
	- Output1.txt: each line shall contain the output of a relation query in the following format (dist,sca).
	- Output2.txt: each line shall contain the odd word deduced from the outcast detection functionality.
2- For the SCA you should print all words in the common ancestor. 
3- In case there is ORing for sca of a given relation query output, outputting one is enough (for example, output in test case file is a OR b, you can output a only OR b only)
3- After you write the oputput in a text file, you need to compare with the one in the testcase.

	To compare your output file with the testcase, please use one of the below tools or any other comparison tool you have.
	Make sure you have any with you on the delivery day
